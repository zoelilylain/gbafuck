WIP Brainfuck Interpreter for Game Boy Advance using DevKitPro

## Building
You will need DevKitPro installed. Specifically, the gba-dev package they provide.  
After that, just run make. You should get a .gba file for use on flashcarts or emulators.

## Keybinds
A adds, B subtracts, Select clears.

## Warning!
This is heavily WIP! There is only one memory cell at the moment! Most commands are missing!

## Thanks
The DevKitPro team, for providing example code and, well, the devkit.
